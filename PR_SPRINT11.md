# Sprint 11 - Multi-Asset + Execution Integration PR

## Overview

This PR implements the multi-asset trading functionality that allows the system to trade both cryptocurrencies and equities in paper mode. The implementation follows a clean abstraction approach with interfaces for data feeds and execution engines.

## Key Changes

1. **Interfaces and Abstractions**:
   - Created `DataFeed` interface to standardize market data reception
   - Created `ExecutionEngine` interface to standardize order execution
   - Implemented concrete classes for each (CoinGeckoFeed, AlpacaFeed, SimEngine, etc.)

2. **Flexible AssetAgent**:
   - Extended AssetAgent to accept DataFeed and ExecutionEngine in constructor
   - Added dynamic feed and execution engine selection based on asset class

3. **Database Changes**:
   - Added SymbolRegistry table to track asset classes and exchanges
   - Updated Order and Trade tables with new columns (botId, type, externalId)
   - Added migration script to apply these changes

4. **Resilient Execution**:
   - Implemented retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Added error logging and fallback to simulation when APIs fail
   - Used small quantities (0.001 BTC, 1 share) as required

5. **Testing**:
   - Created test script for verifying multi-asset trading
   - Added sanity check to run for 1 hour and verify fills

## How to Test

1. Apply the database migration:
   ```
   pnpm run db:apply-migration -r server
   ```

2. Run the multi-asset test:
   ```
   pnpm run test-multi-asset -r server
   ```

3. Or run the full bot:
   ```
   pnpm run run:multi-asset -r server
   ```

## Configuration

Credentials for the external services need to be set as environment variables:
- `ALPACA_API_KEY` and `ALPACA_API_SECRET` for equities
- `BINANCE_TESTNET_API_KEY` and `BINANCE_TESTNET_API_SECRET` for crypto

## Documentation

See the `MULTI_ASSET.md` file for detailed documentation on how to use and configure the multi-asset trading functionality.
