# Branch Cleanup

The following branches have been deleted as they have been fully merged into `main`:

1. `fix-main-revert`
2. `Attempted-build-fixes`
3. `staging`

These branches were reviewed and confirmed to have all changes already integrated into the main branch. Removing them helps maintain a cleaner repository.
