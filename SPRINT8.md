## Overview

This PR adds two new data sources to enhance our trading platform:

- Implemented order book depth polling (1-minute intervals)
- Created simple NLP for sentiment analysis
- Calculated order book imbalance metrics

### 3. Trading Strategy Integration
- Extended IndicatorCache to track sentiment and order book data
- Modified TrendFollowMA to skip long signals during negative sentiment
- Modified RangeBounce to avoid trading during high order book imbalance

### 4. Gatekeeper Integration
- Added sentiment and order book features to ML feature vector
- Updated training pipeline to incorporate new features

## Benefits

- Improved trade timing by incorporating market sentiment

- Unit tests for sentiment analysis and order book metrics
- Integration tests with strategy modifications
- End-to-end tests of the complete system

## Next Steps

After merging, we'll need to:
1. Monitor data collection performance
2. Analyze impact on trading decisions
3. Fine-tune sensitivity parameters
